# Civilization

> We are making a game for the first time, please advise us bro!

## How to play
- We are going to design **a map** to show **all the city or mountain**.
- Then you can click the city to **upgrade** and click the mountain to **build up a city**.
- You can also **place a factory or a mine hole** to _**made production or digging for gold**_.
This is far more interesting than you imagine, so _<font color="#8f0">going on</font>_!

If you have any ideas, please contact us! [Our information](#contact-us)
## Multiplayer games
> [!NOTE]
> Now, we didn't design AI, so the "_Multiplayer games_" will be far away...
